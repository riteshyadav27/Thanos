## Thanos Snap - The Puzzle

I have created multiple puzzles that test various abilities related to soft skills of a person such as perception, curiosity etc. 
The website also stores the time each user takes and the number of attempts that a user has taken for completed each puzzle.<br /> This way, the website determines the soft skills of the user.
